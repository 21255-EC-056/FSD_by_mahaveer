	<p>Widespread improvements in the quality of life of many of the world’s populations have gone hand-in-hand with increased demands on natural resources. The planet is struggling to keep up, with increases in the average global temperature and the frequency of extreme weather events transforming ecosystems around the world and threatening entire species of plants and animals.</p><br>

	<p>Global warming is a phenomenon where the earth’s average temperature rises due to increased amounts of greenhouse gases.<a href="https://www.greenhouse.com/">Greenhouse</a>  gases such as <strong>carbon dioxide, </strong>methane and ozone(O<sub>2</sub>) trap the incoming radiation from the sun. This effect creates a natural <b>“blanket”</b>, which <i>prevents the heat from escaping </i>back into the <u>atmosphere</u>. This effect is called the<big> greenhouse effect.</big>

		Contrary to popular belief, greenhouse gases are not inherently bad. In fact, the <mark>greenhouse effect</mark> is quite important for life on earth. Without this effect, the sun’s radiation would be reflected back into the atmosphere, 4<sup>3</sup>=64 freezing the surface and making <small>life</small> impossible. However, when greenhouse gases in excess amounts get trapped, serious repercussions begin to appear.</p> <p>The polar ice caps begin to melt, leading to a rise in sea levels. Furthermore, the greenhouse effect is <em>accelerated </em>when polar ice caps and sea ice melts. This is due to the fact the ice reflects 50% to 70% of the sun’s rays back into space, but without ice, the solar radiation gets absorbed. <mark><b>Seawater reflects only 6% </b></mark>of the sun’s radiation back into space. What’s more <del>frightening </del>is the fact that the poles contain large amounts of carbon dioxide trapped within the ice. If this ice melts, it will significantly contribute to global warming. 

		A related scenario when this phenomenon goes out of control is the runaway-greenhouse effect. </p><hr>

			<p style="font-family: lucida calligraphy">"The modern greenhouse is usually a glass- or plastic-enclosed framed structure that is used for the production of fruits, vegetables, flowers, and any other plants that require special conditions of temperature. The basic structural forms are the span-type greenhouse, which has a double-sloped, or A-shaped, roof, and the lean-to greenhouse, which has only one roof slope and leans against the side of a building. Two or more span-type greenhouses are sometimes joined side by side so that they have fewer external walls, and heating costs are consequently less. A has a large expanse of glazing on its sides and roof so that the plants are exposed to natural light for much of the day. Glass has been the traditional glazing material, but plastic films, such as polyethylene or polyvinyl, and fibreglass are also common."
